## Install

### Download

Grab the latest [release here](https://github.com/SpongeBobSun/LiveDeveloperExcuses/releases)!

### Install

Since I haven't figure out how to sign a screensaver properly, you might suffer some minor signing issues.

After unzipped the latest release, you need to right-click the `.saver` file then choose open instead of double-click it. Then you need to click on the open button in following popup dialog.

## Where can I get a decent video background?

There are a lot of royalty-free video sites. 

I recommend [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/videos/) and [Visualdon](https://visualdon.uk/).
